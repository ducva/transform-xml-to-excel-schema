# transform-xml-to-excel-schema

## Purpose

When working with Japanese partners, they have many documents of Logical Design (a legacy item from Waterfall). One of them is ER schema. 

Now, I have DB design already, and I need a ER Schema document to share with my Japanese partners, so this tool was born.
